# Printer-bot-NXT-lego-mindstorms

This repository is created to share the code that I had written for the NXT lego mindstorms printer bot, which was written in C programming language.
The building instructions of the printer bot can be found in the unofficial LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 Inventor's Guide 2.0, 2nd edition,
which I also included in this repository.

Picture below shows the completed project.<br/>
